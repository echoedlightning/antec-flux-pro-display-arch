# Antec Flux Pro Display Configuration

# Path to CPU temperature sensor
# On Arch Linux, this is typically found under /sys/class/hwmon/
# Use 'sensors' command from lm_sensors package to find your specific path
# Common locations:
#   - AMD CPUs: /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input (k10temp)
#   - Intel CPUs: /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input (coretemp)
cpu_device = "/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input"

# Polling interval in milliseconds
# How often to update the display with new temperature readings
polling_interval = 200
